* Notation and terminology: Some conventions are introduced and then seemingly never used again. (Universes? Yoneda embedding?)

All the tricky points on notation involved handling the correct hierarchy of universes on chapters 3-6; now all notation relies on common sense, or in well-established tradition in triangulated category theory, thus the paragraph has been removed.

* proof of 1.7: Conditions HO1 and HO2 are swapped.

True: this has been edited.

* p.12: Given a square in D viewed as a morphism f in D^2, does the orthogonal complement of cone(f) depend on the choice of the cone?

* 1.13: why is the "left class" closed under suspension?

* proof of 2.11: reference to part of proof of Lemma 2.10 could be avoided by stating that as a separate Lemma, thereby making the proof more reader-friendly.
