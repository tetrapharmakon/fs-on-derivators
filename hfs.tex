\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
We define \emph{triangulated factorization systems} on a given triangulated category, and prove that a suitable subclass thereof (the \emph{normal triangulated torsion theories}) corresponds bijectively to $t$-structures on the same category.

This result is then placed in the framework of derivators regarding a triangulated category as the underlying category of a stable derivator. More generally, we define \emph{derivator factorization systems} in the 2-category $\PDer$, also formally describing them as algebras for a suitable strict 2-monad (this result is of independent interest), and prove that a similar characterization still holds true: for a stable derivator $\D$, a suitable class of derivator factorization systems (the \emph{normal derivator torsion theories}) correspond bijectively with $t$-structures on the underlying category $\D(\uno)$ of the derivator.

These two result can be regarded as the triangulated- and derivator- analogues, respectively, of the theorem that says that `$t$-structures are normal torsion theories' in the setting of stable $\infty$-categories, showing how the result remains true whatever the chosen model for stable homotopy theory is.
