\begin{abstract}
% We define \emph{triangulated factorization systems} on triangulated categories, and prove that a suitable subclass thereof (the \emph{normal triangulated torsion theories}) corresponds bijectively to $t$-structures on the same category.
%
% In subsequent work, this result will be placed in the more natural framework of derivators regarding a triangulated category as the base of a stable derivator.
We define \emph{derivator factorization systems} in the 2-category $\PDer$, describing them as algebras for a suitable strict 2-monad (this result is of independent interest), and prove a characterization of $t$-structures in terms of such factorization systems: given a stable derivator $\D$, a suitable class of derivator factorization systems (the \emph{normal derivator torsion theories}) correspond bijectively with $t$-structures on the base $\D(\uno)$ of the derivator.

Coupled with prior results about \emph{triangulated} NTTs, this can be regarded as the triangulated- and derivator- analogues, respectively, of the theorem that says that `$t$-structures are normal torsion theories' in the setting of stable $\infty$-categories, showing how the result remains true whatever the chosen model for stable homotopy theory is.
